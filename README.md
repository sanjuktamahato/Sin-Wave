# Sin-Wave
A sine wave is a smooth, periodic oscillation that describes a repetitive wave pattern. It is defined by the function $y = \sin(x)$ and is fundamental in trigonometry, physics, and signal processing. Sine waves represent sound waves, light waves, and alternating current, with constant amplitude and frequency.
